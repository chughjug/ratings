  const [stats, games] = await Promise.all([
    this.getPlayerStats(username),
    this.getPlayerGames(username, 1)
  ]);
  
  return {
    username: profile.username,
    name: profile.name || profile.username,

    await new Promise(resolve => 
      setTimeout(resolve, this.rateLimitDelay - timeSinceLastRequest)
    );
  }
  
  this.lastRequestTime = Date.now();
}
```
