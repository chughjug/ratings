# UI Cache Fix Summary

## Problem
Updated UI wasn't showing up on new deployments due to service worker caching and aggressive browser caching.

## Root Causes
1. **Service Worker Cache**: The service worker had a hardcoded cache version (`chess-tournament-v1.0.0`) that didn't update on deployments
2. **Browser Caching**: Static files were being cached aggressively by browsers
3. **No Cache Invalidation**: No mechanism to force cache updates on new deployments

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Service Worker Cache Versioning
- Updated `client/public/sw.js` to use timestamp-based cache version
- Each build now generates a unique cache name using `BUILD_TIMESTAMP`
- Old caches are automatically deleted on service worker activation

### 2. Automated Build Scripts
- **`client/scripts/update-service-worker-version.js`**: Updates the BUILD_TIMESTAMP in sw.js on each build
- **`client/scripts/update-manifest-version.js`**: Updates the manifest.json version to force service worker update
- Both scripts run automatically before each build via `prebuild` hook

### 3. Cache-Busting Headers
- Updated `server/index.js` to add proper Cache-Control headers
- Service worker (`sw.js`) and `index.html` now have `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` headers
- Static assets (JS, CSS, images) have short-term caching (1 hour)

### 4. Service Worker Activation Improvements
- Service worker now deletes ALL old caches that don't match the current BUILD_TIMESTAMP
- This ensures complete cache invalidation on each deployment

## Files Modified

### Core Files
1. **`client/public/sw.js`**
   - Changed hardcoded version to dynamic `BUILD_TIMESTAMP`
   - Updated cache deletion logic to remove ALL old caches

2. **`client/package.json`**
   - Added `prebuild` script to run version update scripts before build
   - Ensures cache version is updated on every build

3. **`server/index.js`**
   - Added cache-control headers to prevent aggressive caching
   - Service worker and HTML files are never cached
   - Static assets have short-term cache

### New Files
1. **`client/scripts/update-service-worker-version.js`**
   - Updates BUILD_TIMESTAMP in service worker on each build

2. **`client/scripts/update-manifest-version.js`**
   - Updates version in manifest.json to force service worker updates

## How It Works

1. **On Build**:
   - `prebuild` script runs automatically
   - Updates BUILD_TIMESTAMP in sw.js with current timestamp
   - Updates version in manifest.json
   - React build runs with updated files

2. **On Deployment**:
   - New service worker file with new timestamp is deployed
   - Browser detects updated service worker
   - Old caches are deleted
   - Fresh cache is created with new timestamp

3. **On User Access**:
   - Browser checks for updated service worker
   - Service worker activation deletes old caches
   - Fresh UI is loaded from server

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

```bash
# Build the project
cd client
npm run build

# Check that sw.js has new timestamp
grep BUILD_TIMESTAMP public/sw.js

# Deploy to Heroku
cd ..
git add .
git commit -m "Fix UI cache issues"
git push heroku clean-deployment:main

# After deployment, visit the app
# The UI should show the latest version
```

## Browser Cache Clearing (For Testing)

If you need to manually clear browser cache for testing:

1. **Chrome/Edge**: `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` → Clear cached images and files
2. **Firefox**: `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` → Clear cache
3. **Safari**: `Cmd+Option+E` → Empty Caches

Or use DevTools:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

## Prevention

The fix ensures this won't happen again because:
- Cache version updates automatically on each build
- No manual intervention required
- Old caches are automatically cleaned up
- Proper HTTP headers prevent aggressive caching

## Deployment Notes

- The `prebuild` script runs automatically before each build
- No manual steps needed during deployment
- Cache invalidation happens automatically
- Users will see the latest UI immediately on new deployments
