# Heroku API Player Search Integration

## Summary
Successfully integrated the new Heroku API-based player search into the existing system. This provides a faster, more reliable player search compared to the previous Selenium-based methods.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Python CLI Script (`search_player.py`)
A command-line tool for searching US Chess players:
```bash
python3 search_player.py "Player Name" [max_results]
```

**Features:**
- Connects to Heroku API: `https://player-search-api-60b22a3031bd.herokuapp.com`
- Returns formatted table of players with ratings
- Supports max_results parameter

**Example Usage:**
```bash
python3 search_player.py Chugh
python3 search_player.py "Smith" 20
```

### 2. Node.js Integration (`server/services/playerSearch.js`)
Added `searchUSChessPlayersHerokuAPI()` function that:
- Uses the Heroku API as the primary search method
- Falls back to Puppeteer if API fails
- Caches results for performance
- Returns player objects with name, memberId, state, and ratings

### 3. Test Results
âœ… Tested successfully with multiple queries:
- "Chugh" - Found 3 players including Aarush CHUGH (1568 rating)
- "Smith" - Found 3 players including Smith G BARTLEY (105 rating)
- "Johnson" - Found 3 players including Johnson ABRAHAM (998 rating)

## Player Data Structure

Each player object includes:
```javascript
{
  name: string,              // Player's full name
  memberId: string,          // USCF Member ID
  state: string,             // US State (or "N/A")
  ratings: {
    regular: number,         // Regular rating
    quick: number,           // Quick rating
    blitz: number,           // Blitz rating
    online_regular: number,  // Online regular
    online_quick: number,    // Online quick
    online_blitz: number     // Online blitz
  },
  uscf_id: string,           // Same as memberId
  rating: number,            // Primary rating (regular)
  expiration_date: string    // USCF membership expiration
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Speed**: API responses are much faster than web scraping
2. **Reliability**: Dedicated API with consistent data format
3. **Caching**: Results are cached for repeated searches
4. **Fallback**: Automatically uses Puppeteer if API is unavailable
5. **Data Quality**: Structured data with all rating types

## Integration Points

The new Heroku API search is now the **default** search method (`searchUSChessPlayers`). If the API fails, the system automatically falls back to:
1. Puppeteer-based search (`searchUSChessPlayersPuppeteer`)
2. Selenium-based methods (as last resort)

## Files Modified

1. `search_player.py` - New Python CLI for testing/searching players
2. `server/services/playerSearch.js` - Added Heroku API integration

## Next Steps

To use the new search in your application:
```javascript
const { searchUSChessPlayers } = require('./server/services/playerSearch');

// Search for players
const players = await searchUSChessPlayers('Player Name', 10);
```

The system will automatically use the Heroku API with fallback to other methods as needed.
