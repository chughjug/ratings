# âœ… Quad Tournament - All Rounds Generation Update

## What Changed

The quad system now generates pairings for **ALL rounds** in a single operation and **automatically reassigns sections** (overwriting existing ones).

## Key Features

### 1. One-Click Generation
- Click "ðŸŽ¯ Generate Quads" button ONCE
- Generates pairings for all tournament rounds automatically
- No need to generate round by round

### 2. Section Reassignment
- **All existing sections are deleted** first
- Fresh sections created: quad-1, quad-2, quad-3, etc.
- Players remain in same quads across all rounds
- Same round-robin pairings within each quad for each round

### 3. Complete Results
- Shows breakdown for each round
- Total games across all rounds
- Total byes across all rounds

## How It Works

### Before (Old Way)
```
1. Generate Round 1 â†’ shows Quads for Round 1 only
2. Generate Round 2 â†’ shows Quads for Round 2 only
3. Generate Round 3 â†’ repeat
4. Generate Round 4 â†’ repeat
(4 button clicks needed)
```

### After (New Way)
```
1. Generate Quads â†’ ALL 4 rounds generated
   âœ… Sections reassigned
   âœ… Round 1 pairings created
   âœ… Round 2 pairings created
   âœ… Round 3 pairings created
   âœ… Round 4 pairings created
(1 button click = done!)
```
