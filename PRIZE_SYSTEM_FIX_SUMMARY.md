# Prize System Fix Summary

## Problem
The prize system wasn't displaying prizes anywhere (not in public view, not in admin view) because:
1. The `prizes` table was missing from the database schema
2. Backend queries were trying to fetch from a non-existent table
3. Prize configurations couldn't be saved or displayed

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Prizes Table to Database Schema
**File:** `server/database.js`

Added two tables:
- `prizes` - Defines prize configurations for tournaments
- `prize_distributions` - Tracks which players received which prizes

### 2. Fixed Prize Queries
**File:** `server/routes/tournaments.js`

Updated queries to properly fetch from the `prizes` table and return correct data structure.

## How the Prize System Works

### Prize Display Locations

1. **Public Tournament View** (`/public/:id`)
   - Shows a "Prizes" tab when prizes exist
   - Displays all prizes for the tournament
   - Available at: `client/src/pages/PublicTournamentDisplay.tsx`

2. **Admin Tournament Detail Page** (`/tournaments/:id`)
   - Has a "Prizes" tab for configuration and viewing
   - Includes `PrizeDisplay` component for detailed view
   - Available at: `client/src/pages/TournamentDetail.tsx`

### Prize Configuration

To configure prizes for a tournament:

1. Go to Tournament Detail page
2. Click the "Prizes" tab
3. Click "Configure Prizes" button
4. In the modal:
   - Enable prizes checkbox
   - Add sections from your tournament
   - Configure prizes per section:
     - **Position prizes** (1st, 2nd, 3rd place)
     - **Rating prizes** (Under X, Class categories)
     - **Prize types** (Cash, Trophy, Medal, Plaque)
   - Save configuration

### Section-Specific Prizes

The prize system supports section-specific prizes:

1. In Prize Configuration modal, click on a section name to add it
2. Configure prizes for each section:
   - Add prizes with position (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd)
   - Add rating-based prizes (e.g., "Under 1600 1st Place")
   - Set prize types and amounts
3. Each section can have different prize structures
4. Use "Quick Setup" to auto-generate standard prize structures

### Prize Types Supported

- **Cash** - Monetary prizes with amounts
- **Trophy** - Physical trophies
- **Medal** - Medals
- **Plaque** - Plaques

### Rating Categories Supported

The system recognizes various rating categories:
- **Under prizes**: "Under 1600", "Under 1200", etc.
- **USCF Classes**: "Class A (1800-1999)", "Class B (1600-1799)", etc.
- **Unrated**: For players without ratings
- **Ranges**: "1200-1399", "1400-1599", etc.

## How to Set Up Section-Specific Prizes

1. **Open Prize Configuration**
   - Go to tournament detail page
   - Click "Prizes" tab
   - Click "Configure Prizes" button

2. **Add Sections**
   - Available sections will be listed at the top
   - Click section names to add them to your prize configuration
   - They'll appear as cards below

3. **Configure Prizes for Each Section**
   - For each section card, click "Add Prize"
   - Configure each prize:
     - **Name**: e.g., "1st Place"
     - **Type**: Cash, Trophy, Medal, or Plaque
     - **Position**: 1, 2, 3, etc. (for position prizes)
     - **Rating Category**: e.g., "Under 1600" (for rating prizes)
     - **Amount**: For cash prizes
     - **Description**: Optional

4. **Save Configuration**
   - Click "Save Configuration"
   - When tournament is completed, click "Calculate Prizes" to distribute prizes

## Example: Under Prize Setup

To set up an "Under 1600" 1st Place prize:

1. Add a prize to your section
2. Set:
   - Name: "Under 1600 1st Place"
   - Type: Trophy (or Cash with amount)
   - **Leave Position empty** (0 or blank)
   - Rating Category: "Under 1600"
   - (For cash) Amount: e.g., $50

3. Save configuration
4. When you calculate prizes, the system will:
   - Find all players with rating < 1600
   - Award the prize to the highest scoring eligible player

## Auto-Assignment

Enable "Auto-assign prizes when final round is completed" to automatically distribute prizes when the last round finishes.

## Quick Setup

Use the "Generate Standard Structure" feature to auto-generate:
- Top 3-5 position cash prizes (based on player count)
- Top 3 trophy prizes
- Under prizes for common rating categories
- All scaled based on your prize fund

## Troubleshooting

**Prizes not showing:**
- Make sure you've enabled prizes in the configuration
- Ensure you've added sections with prizes configured
- Verify prizes are calculated by clicking "Calculate Prizes" button

**Section prizes not working:**
- Make sure players are assigned to sections
- Verify section names match exactly between players and prize configuration
- Check that you've added prizes to that specific section in the configuration

**Under prizes not awarded:**
- Verify the rating category text matches the format (e.g., "Under 1600")
- Check that players actually fall into that rating category
- Ensure players have ratings (or use "Unrated" for unrated players)
