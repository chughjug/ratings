# ‚úÖ Fix: Google Apps Script doGet() Function Added

## Issue
The Google Apps Script webhook was showing error:
```
Script function not found: doGet
```

This happens when someone accesses the webhook URL in a browser (which sends a GET request) instead of sending a POST request.

## Solution
Added `doGet()` function that:
- ‚úÖ Handles GET requests properly
- ‚úÖ Returns a friendly status page
- ‚úÖ Shows webhook is active and ready
- ‚úÖ Provides instructions for configuration and testing

## What Changed

Added `doGet()` function to `google-apps-script-pairings.gs` that returns a professional status page showing:
- ‚úÖ Webhook status (Active and Ready)
- ‚úÖ How the system works
- ‚úÖ Configuration options
- ‚úÖ Webhook payload format
- ‚úÖ Testing instructions
- ‚úÖ Logging information

## Action Required: REDEPLOY

You need to redeploy the Google Apps Script with the updated code:

### Step 1: Update the Code
1. Open your Google Apps Script project
2. Replace the entire code with the updated `google-apps-script-pairings.gs`
3. Save

### Step 2: Create New Deployment
1. Click "Deploy" button (top right)
2. Click "New deployment"
3. Click the gear icon ‚Üí select "Web app"
4. Set:
   - Execute as: Your account
   - Who has access: Anyone
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Copy the new deployment URL

### Step 3: Update Environment Variable
```bash
PAIRING_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK=<new_webhook_url>
```

Set this in your backend's .env or environment configuration.

### Step 4: Test

Visit your webhook URL in a browser - you should now see:
```
üèÜ Chess Tournament Pairing Notifier

‚úÖ Webhook is Active and Ready

[Instructions and status page]
```

Instead of the error message.

## Testing the Webhook

### Option 1: Browser Test
Simply visit the webhook URL in your browser:
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/usercontent
```

You'll see the status page confirming the webhook is active.

### Option 2: Actual Pairing Generation
Generate pairings and players will receive emails automatically:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/pairings/generate/section \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tournamentId": "tournament-id",
    "round": 1,
    "sectionName": "Open"
  }'
```

## Key Functions

### doGet(e)
- Handles GET requests
- Returns HTML status page
- Shows webhook is active
- Provides configuration guide
- Explains how to test

### doPost(e)
- Handles POST requests from backend
- Receives pairing data
- Sends personalized emails to players
- Logs results

## Verification

‚úÖ Google Apps Script now has both functions:
- `doGet()` - handles browser visits
- `doPost()` - handles webhook POST requests

‚úÖ No linting errors

‚úÖ Ready for deployment

## Next Steps

1. Update `google-apps-script-pairings.gs` with the new code
2. Create new deployment in Google Apps Script
3. Copy new webhook URL
4. Update `PAIRING_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK` environment variable
5. Test by visiting webhook URL in browser
6. Generate pairings to verify email notifications work

**Issue Fixed!** ‚úÖ

The webhook now properly handles both GET requests (browser visits) and POST requests (backend webhooks).
