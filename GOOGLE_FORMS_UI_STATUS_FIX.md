# ✅ Google Forms UI Status - Fixed

## What Was Wrong
The sheet wasn't showing "connected to sheet" or any status because:
- ❌ `onOpen()` function was missing
- ❌ Menu wasn't being created on sheet open
- ❌ UI wasn't initialized when users opened the sheet

## What We Fixed

### 1. Added `onOpen()` Function
Now automatically runs when you open the Google Sheet:
```javascript
function onOpen(e) {
  // Creates menu
  // Adds form import menu
  // Shows initialization log
}
```

### 2. Updated `testConnection()` 
- ✅ Now uses FORMS_CONFIG instead of old CONFIG
- ✅ Tests the correct API endpoint
- ✅ Shows connection status with tournament name
- ✅ Provides clear success/failure messages

### 3. Updated `showRegistrationInfo()`
- ✅ Now displays FORMS_CONFIG information
- ✅ Shows form import settings
- ✅ Lists all supported form fields
- ✅ Shows import endpoint
- ✅ Nice formatted output

## How It Works Now

### When You Open the Sheet:
1. `onOpen()` is automatically triggered
2. ✓ Menu "Chess Tournament" is created
3. ✓ Menu "Google Forms Import" is added
4. ✓ Console shows: "✅ Google Apps Script initialized"
5. ✓ You can now see all menu options

### Menu Options:
```

├─ Sync New Players Only
