# USCF Player Name Import - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 What You Need to Know

When importing players by USCF ID, player names are now **automatically extracted** from the USCF website.

```
Input:  USCF ID = 14970943
Output: Name = "AARUSH CHUGH", Rating = 1568, Expiration = 03/31/2026
```

## 📋 For Users

### Importing Players via CSV

1. Create CSV with USCF IDs:
```csv
Name,USCF ID
,14970943
,12345678
```

2. Upload the CSV - names are automatically populated! ✅

## 👨‍💻 For Developers

### Using the API

```javascript
const { getUSCFInfo } = require('./server/services/ratingLookup');

const result = await getUSCFInfo('14970943');
// Returns:
// {
//   name: 'AARUSH CHUGH',
//   rating: 1568,
//   expirationDate: '03/31/2026',
//   isActive: true,
//   error: null
// }
```

### Database Schema

Ensure your `players` table has a `name` column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN name TEXT;
```

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Fetch** USCF page using player ID
2. **Parse** HTML to find player data row
3. **Extract** name from format: `ID: NAME`
4. **Store** in database with rating and expiration
5. **Cache** for 30 minutes for instant reuse

## ⚡ Performance

| Scenario | Time |
|----------|------|
| First lookup | 2-5 seconds |
| Cached lookup | <1ms |
| Batch import | Parallel processing |

## ✅ Backward Compatible

- Existing code works unchanged
- `name` field is optional
- No breaking API changes
- No performance impact

## 🧪 Quick Test

```bash
# Test that extraction is working
node -e "
const { getUSCFInfo } = require('./server/services/ratingLookup');
getUSCFInfo('14970943').then(r => {
  console.log('Name:', r.name);
  console.log('Rating:', r.rating);
});
"
```

Expected output:
```
Name: AARUSH CHUGH
Rating: 1568
```

## 🎯 Key Features

✅ Automatic name extraction
✅ No manual data entry
✅ Uses official USCF records
✅ Instant cached lookups
✅ Batch processing support
✅ Complete backward compatibility

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Name not extracted?**
- Verify USCF ID is correct (8-10 digits)
- Check internet connection
- Wait for first lookup (2-5 seconds)
- Check server logs

**Wrong name?**
- USCF website might be outdated
- Check player's USCF profile directly
- Manual correction available in UI

## 💡 Tips

1. Names are cached - repeated lookups are instant
2. Batch imports use parallel workers for speed
3. If extraction fails, rating is still imported
4. Manual names can be overridden if needed
