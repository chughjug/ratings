## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Pre-Push Verification
```bash
cd /Users/aarushchugh/ratings
git status
# Expected: 3 modified files + 5 new documentation files
```

### Step 2: Commit Changes
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: improve player search accuracy

- Remove mock data fallback, return empty results instead
- Add relevance-based filtering and sorting of results
- Improve name validation and extraction
- Apply filtering at multiple levels for consistency
- Add comprehensive documentation and verification"
```

### Step 3: Push to Heroku
```bash
git push heroku main
# Wait for deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)
```

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment
```bash
heroku logs --tail
# Watch for: "Deployed", "Restarting", "Restarted"
# Should NOT see: "Error", "crash", "failed"
```

### Step 5: Test Endpoints (5 minutes after deploy)

**Test 1: Invalid search**
```bash
curl "https://your-app.herokuapp.com/api/players/search?q=XyzzZzz999&limit=10"
# Expected: {"success": true, "data": {"players": [], "count": 0}}
```

**Test 2: Valid search**
```bash
curl "https://your-app.herokuapp.com/api/players/search?q=smith&limit=5"
# Expected: Real players sorted by relevance
```

**Test 3: Registration form**
- Navigate to registration page
- Search for player name
- Verify results are accurate (not fake data)
- Verify results are sorted by relevance

### Step 6: Monitor Logs (15 minutes)
```bash
# Check for errors
heroku logs --grep "error|failed" --tail -n 50
# Should be empty or minimal

# Check for successful searches
heroku logs --grep "search completed" --tail -n 20
# Should see entries like: "Puppeteer search completed for: smith (4523ms) - Found 5 relevant players"
```

### Step 7: Full System Test (after 15 minutes)
1. âœ… Test registration form search
2. âœ… Test CSV/Excel import
3. âœ… Test API import endpoint
4. âœ… Verify ratings are still looked up correctly
5. âœ… Verify sections are auto-assigned correctly

---

## Success Criteria

All of these should be TRUE after deployment:

- [x] Search endpoint responds without errors
- [x] Invalid searches return empty array (not mock data)
- [x] Valid searches return sorted results
- [x] Exact matches prioritized
- [x] No browser crashes in logs
- [x] Response times < 10 seconds
- [x] Cache hit rate improving
- [x] No new error patterns
- [x] Registration form works
- [x] Players registered with correct data

---

## Rollback Plan

If anything goes wrong:

### Option 1: Quick Rollback (Recommended)
```bash
heroku releases
heroku releases:rollback
# Takes ~30 seconds
```

### Option 2: Git Rollback
```bash
git revert HEAD~1
git push heroku main
# Takes ~2 minutes
```

### Option 3: Manual Restart
```bash
heroku dyno:restart
# If it's just a temporary issue
```

---

## Monitoring After Deployment

### Daily (Week 1)
- Check error logs: `heroku logs --grep "error" --tail -n 100`
- Check search performance: `heroku logs --grep "search completed" --tail -n 50`
- Verify no mock data: Search for "generated mock"

### Weekly (After Week 1)
- Monitor error rate (should be < 1%)
- Monitor response times (average 2-5s)
- Monitor cache hit rate (should be > 80%)
- Check memory usage (normal 150-300MB)

### Monthly
- Gather user feedback
- Analyze search patterns
- Check if any accented names are being rejected
- Consider performance optimizations

---

## What to Expect

### Before Deployment
- Some users getting fake players
- No result sorting
- Poor name extraction
- Inaccurate registrations

### After Deployment (Hour 1)
- Empty results for some searches (honest)
- Results sorted correctly
- Better name quality
- Accurate registrations
- Cache rebuilding (new format)

### After Deployment (Day 1)
- Cache hit rate improving
- Faster searches (more cache hits)
- Fewer support issues
- Better data quality

## Troubleshooting Quick Guide

| Issue | Check | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Empty results for valid players | `heroku logs --tail` | Check if US Chess site is down |
| High response times | Memory usage | Restart dyno or upgrade |
| Browser crashes | Chrome buildpack | Reinstall buildpack |
| Errors in logs | Specific error message | See HEROKU_DEPLOYMENT_PLAYER_SEARCH.md |
| Cache not working | `grep "Cache hit"` logs | Check cache key format |

## Communication

### If issues occur, check:
1. `HEROKU_DEPLOYMENT_PLAYER_SEARCH.md` - Troubleshooting section
2. `CORE_FUNCTIONALITY_VERIFICATION.md` - What's preserved vs. changed
3. `heroku logs --tail` - Real-time error logs

### If rollback is needed:
1. `heroku releases:rollback` - Instant rollback
2. Investigate root cause
3. Fix and redeploy
