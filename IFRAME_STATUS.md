# Iframe Embedding Status

## âœ… Configuration Complete

Your server is now configured to allow iframe embedding.

### What Was Changed

1. **Content-Security-Policy**: Set `frame-ancestors: ["*"]` to allow embedding from any origin
2. **X-Frame-Options**: Explicitly disabled via `xFrameOptions: false`
3. **Custom Middleware**: Added after helmet to ensure proper header setting

### Verification

Run this command to verify the headers:

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:5000 | grep -i "content-security"
```

You should see:
```
Content-Security-Policy: ...frame-ancestors *;
```

You should **NOT** see:
```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```
or
```
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
```

### Testing

I've created two test files:

1. **`test-simple-iframe.html`** - Simple test page with an iframe
2. **`test-iframe-embedding.html`** - More comprehensive test page

Open either file in your browser to test embedding.

### If It's Still Not Working

If you're still experiencing issues embedding the site, it might be because:

1. **Browser Cache**: Clear your browser cache and try again
2. **Heroku Deployment**: The changes need to be deployed to Heroku for production
3. **Mixed Content**: Make sure both the parent page and iframe use the same protocol (both HTTP or both HTTPS)

### Deployment to Heroku

When you're ready to deploy:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Enable iframe embedding"
git push heroku main
```

Then test with your Heroku URL instead of localhost.

### Files Modified

- `server/index.js` - Updated helmet configuration and added custom middleware
