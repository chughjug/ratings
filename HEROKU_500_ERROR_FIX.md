# Heroku 500 Error Fix Summary

## Problems Identified
1. **Missing `calculateTiebreakers` function**: The function was being called but didn't exist, causing errors when viewing public tournaments
2. **Database path issues**: The database connection wasn't properly configured for Heroku's DATABASE_URL
3. **Missing database columns**: Heroku database may have been missing newer columns like `tournament_information`
4. **Insufficient error logging**: Made it difficult to debug issues in production

## Root Causes
1. The `calculateTiebreakers` function was imported but never existed in `server/utils/tiebreakers.js`, causing runtime errors
2. The database connection was hardcoded to a local path, not working with Heroku's ephemeral file system
3. The local database had all required columns, but the Heroku database was likely created with an older schema

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Missing `calculateTiebreakers` Function (server/utils/tiebreakers.js)
- Created the missing `calculateTiebreakers` function that was being called but didn't exist
- Function calculates all specified tiebreakers for a list of standings
- Properly handles errors and returns empty tiebreakers object if calculation fails

### 2. Fixed Database Path for Heroku (server/database.js)
- Updated database connection to use `process.env.DATABASE_URL` for Heroku
- Falls back to local path for development
- Added logging to show which database path is being used

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling (server/routes/tournaments.js)
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around tournament creation
- Added detailed console logging to track the exact error
- Improved parameter handling with proper null checks
- Added better error reporting to help debug issues
- Removed duplicate import of `calculateTiebreakers`

### 4. Database Migration System (server/migrations/add-missing-columns.js)
- Created a migration script that adds any missing columns to the tournaments table
- Gracefully handles cases where columns already exist
- Uses `process.env.DATABASE_URL` for Heroku compatibility
- Adds columns: `tournament_information`, `logo_url`, `city`, `state`, `location`, `chief_td_name`, `chief_td_uscf_id`, `chief_arbiter_name`, `chief_arbiter_fide_id`, `chief_organizer_name`, `chief_organizer_fide_id`, `expected_players`, `website`, `public_url`

### 5. Automatic Migration on Startup (server/start-server.js)
- Created a startup script that runs database migrations before starting the server
- Ensures database schema is always up to date on Heroku
- Updated `package.json` to use the new startup script

## Files Modified
1. `server/utils/tiebreakers.js` - Added missing `calculateTiebreakers` function
2. `server/database.js` - Fixed database path to use Heroku's DATABASE_URL
3. `server/routes/tournaments.js` - Enhanced error handling, logging, and removed duplicate import
4. `server/migrations/add-missing-columns.js` - New migration script with Heroku support
5. `server/start-server.js` - New startup script with migration support
6. `package.json` - Updated start script to run migrations

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy these fixes to Heroku:

```bash
# Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Heroku 500 errors for tournament creation"

# Push to Heroku
git push heroku main

# Monitor the logs
heroku logs --tail
```

## Testing
After deployment, test by:
1. Creating a new tournament through the UI
2. Check Heroku logs for any errors
3. Verify tournament appears in the tournament list

## Expected Behavior
- No more 500 errors when creating tournaments
- All tournament columns are available on Heroku
- Automatic database migration on each deployment
- Detailed error logs for debugging if issues persist
