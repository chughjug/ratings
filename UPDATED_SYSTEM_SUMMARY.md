## Files Updated

### 1. Backend: `server/routes/pairings.js`

**Function: `sendPairingNotificationWebhook()`**

Changes:
- ✓ Fetches player emails from database using `db.get()`
- ✓ Includes emails in webhook payload for each player
- ✓ Uses async/await with Promise.all() for parallel queries
- ✓ Non-blocking operation (doesn't slow pairing generation)

**Webhook Payload Now Includes:**
```json
{
  "pairings": [
    {
      "board": 1,
      "white": {
        "id": "player-1",
        "name": "Alice Johnson",
        "rating": 1850,
        "email": "alice@example.com"  // ← NEW
      },
      "black": {
        "id": "player-2",
        "name": "Bob Smith",
        "rating": 1820,
        "email": "bob@example.com"  // ← NEW
      },
      "section": "Open"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Google Apps Script: `google-apps-script-pairings.gs`

**Function: `processPairingsNotification()` - UPDATED**

Changes:
- ✓ Extracts all players from pairings data
- ✓ Creates Map of players to their pairings
- ✓ Tracks emails sent and errors
- ✓ Sends individual email to each player with valid email
- ✓ Logs all success/failure

**Function: `buildPersonalizedEmailContent()` - NEW**

Creates:
- ✓ Subject line with tournament and round
- ✓ Professional HTML email with:
  - Player's board number
  - Player's color (⚪ White or ⚫ Black) with color-coded background
  - Player's name and rating
  - Opponent's name and rating
  - Section information
- ✓ Plain text version for email fallback
- ✓ Clear visual hierarchy with centered layout

## Setup Requirements

### Step 1: Database

Add email column to players table (if not present):

```sql
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN email TEXT;
```

### Step 2: Populate Emails

Add player email addresses:

```sql
UPDATE players SET email = 'player@example.com' WHERE id = 'player-id';
```

### Step 3: Deploy Updated Google Apps Script

1. Copy updated `google-apps-script-pairings.gs`
2. Paste into Google Apps Script editor
3. Save

### Step 4: Set Environment Variable

```bash
PAIRING_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK=https://script.google.com/macros/d/.../usercontent
```

### Step 5: Generate Pairings

When you generate pairings via `/api/pairings/generate/section`, each player automatically receives a personalized email!

## How It Works In Detail

### Backend Process:

1. Pairings are generated
2. `sendPairingNotificationWebhook()` is called
3. For each pairing:
   - Query database for white player email: `db.get('SELECT email FROM players WHERE id = ?')`
   - Query database for black player email
   - Add emails to pairing object
4. Build webhook payload with all pairings + emails
5. Send POST request to Google Apps Script webhook URL
6. Continue (non-blocking)

### Google Apps Script Process:

1. `doPost()` receives webhook request
2. `processPairingsNotification()` processes the payload
3. Build playerPairings Map:
   - Key: player ID
   - Value: { playerName, playerRating, email, pairings: [...] }
4. For each player with valid email:
   - Call `buildPersonalizedEmailContent(tournament, round, playerInfo)`
   - Send email via `GmailApp.sendEmail()`
   - Log success
5. Log to Google Sheet:
   - Timestamp, tournament, round, pairings count, emails sent, errors

  - Error count

## Testing

### Option 1: Run testSendEmail() in Google Apps Script

```javascript
function testSendEmail() {
  const testPayload = {
    event: 'pairings_generated',
    tournament: {
      id: 'test-tournament',
      name: 'Test Tournament',
      format: 'swiss',
      rounds: 5
    },
    round: 1,
    pairings: [
      {
        board: 1,
        white: {
          id: 'p1',
          name: 'Alice',
          rating: 1850,
          email: 'alice@example.com'
        },
        black: {
          id: 'p2',
          name: 'Bob',
          rating: 1820,
          email: 'bob@example.com'
        },
        section: 'Open'
      }
    ]
  };
  
  processPairingsNotification(testPayload);
}
```

### Option 2: Generate Real Pairings

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/pairings/generate/section \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tournamentId": "tournament-id",
    "round": 1,
    "sectionName": "Open"
  }'
```

Each player in that round automatically receives their personal pairing email!

## Troubleshooting

### Players not receiving emails

**Check 1:** Verify emails in database
```sql
SELECT name, email FROM players WHERE tournament_id = 'your-id' AND email IS NOT NULL;
```

**Check 2:** Check Google Apps Script execution log
- Open Apps Script project
- Click "Execution log"
- Look for "Email sent to" messages

**Check 3:** Verify webhook is being called
```bash
grep -i webhook /path/to/server.log
```

**Check 4:** Verify email format
- Must have @ symbol
- Must be valid email format
- No leading/trailing spaces

### Some players got emails, others didn't

**Possible causes:**
1. Missing email addresses in database
2. Invalid email format for some players
3. Gmail rate limiting (if >100 emails)

**Solutions:**
1. Add missing emails: `UPDATE players SET email = '...' WHERE id = '...'`
2. Fix invalid formats
3. Add delays in Apps Script if needed

## Configuration

### Customize Subject Line

In Google Apps Script CONFIG:
```javascript
SUBJECT_TEMPLATE: 'Round {round} - Your Pairing in {tournamentName}'
```

### Add CC/BCC

In CONFIG:
```javascript
CC_EMAILS: ['tournament-director@example.com'],
BCC_EMAILS: ['archive@example.com']
```

These recipients will be CC'd/BCC'd on ALL player emails.

### Rate Limiting

If sending >100 emails causes issues:

```javascript
// In processPairingsNotification()
let delay = 0;
playerPairings.forEach((playerInfo) => {
  Utilities.sleep(delay);
  delay += 500; // 500ms between emails
  
  // Send email...
});
```
