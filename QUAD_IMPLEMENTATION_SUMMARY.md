# Quad Tournament System - Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A complete **quad tournament system** where different tournament styles can have different structures and layouts. Swiss tournaments remain as they were, and quad tournaments now split sections by rating into groups of 4.

## Files Modified/Created

### Backend (Server)

#### 1. **NEW: `/server/utils/quadPairingSystem.js`**
- Core quad pairing logic
- Automatically groups players into quads of 4
- Generates round-robin pairings within each quad
- Uses snake/zigzag algorithm to balance ratings across groups
- Static method for tournament-wide pairing generation

**Key Methods:**
- `createQuads()` - Divide players into groups of 4 by rating
- `generateRoundRobinPairingsForQuad()` - Create pairings within a quad
- `getQuadAssignments()` - Get current quad setup for display
- `generateTournamentQuadPairings()` - Static method for tournament-wide generation

#### 2. **MODIFIED: `/server/routes/pairings.js`**
- Added import for `QuadPairingSystem`
- Added `POST /api/pairings/generate/quad` endpoint
  - Generates quad pairings for a specific round
  - Stores pairings in database with quad ID as section
  - Returns quad assignments and statistics
- Added `GET /api/pairings/quad/:tournamentId/assignments` endpoint
  - Retrieves current quad assignments for a tournament
  - Shows quad composition and player distribution

### Frontend (Client)

#### 1. **MODIFIED: `/client/src/types/index.ts`**
- Added `'quad'` to Tournament format union type
- Added `quad_settings` to `TournamentSettings` interface:
  ```typescript
  quad_settings?: {
    group_size: number;                    // Always 4 for quad
    pairing_type: 'round_robin' | 'swiss'; // How to pair within quads
    group_assignment: 'rating' | 'random' | 'custom'; // Assignment method
    min_players_per_group?: number;
    allow_byes_in_groups?: boolean;
    cross_group_pairings?: boolean;        // Pairings across groups
  }
  ```

#### 2. **MODIFIED: `/client/src/pages/CreateTournament.tsx`**
- Updated format type to include `'quad'`
- Added `'quad'` as option in tournament format dropdown

#### 3. **NEW: `/client/src/components/QuadTournamentDisplay.tsx`**
- React component for displaying quad tournaments
- Features:
  - Summary statistics (total quads, players, current round)
  - Expandable quad cards showing all players
  - Standings table for each quad
  - Pairings organized by quad and round
  - Results display
  - Beautiful gradient UI with Tailwind CSS

## How the System Works

### Player Distribution

1. **Sort** all players by rating (highest first)
2. **Create** containers for each quad based on player count
3. **Distribute** using snake/zigzag pattern for balanced rating:
   - Ensures each quad has a mix of strong and weaker players
   - Examples:
     - 20 players → 5 quads of 4
     - 17 players → Mix of quads (some with 4, some with 3)
     - 16 players → 4 quads of 4

### Round-Robin Within Quads

For a quad of 4 players (A, B, C, D):
- **Round 1:** A vs B, C vs D (2 games)
- **Round 2:** A vs C, B vs D (2 games)
- **Round 3:** A vs D, B vs C (2 games)
- **Total:** 6 pairings, 3 per player

For 3 players: 3 rounds with byes distributed evenly

### Pairings Storage

Pairings are stored in the database with:
- `section` field = quad ID (e.g., "quad-1")
- Allows per-quad pairing independence
- Integrates seamlessly with existing infrastructure

## API Usage Examples

### Generate Quad Pairings

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/pairings/generate/quad \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tournamentId": "tournament-uuid",
    "round": 1,
    "clearExisting": false
  }'
```

**Response includes:**
- Quad assignments with player details
- Total games and byes
- Pairing count stored in database

### Get Quad Assignments

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/pairings/quad/tournament-uuid/assignments
```

**Returns:**
- All quads with player assignments
- Average players per quad
- Total player count

## Integration Points

The quad system integrates with existing infrastructure:

1. **Tournament Format**: New option in tournament creation
2. **Database**: Uses existing pairings table
3. **Standings**: Compatible with existing standings calculation
4. **Results**: Uses existing results table structure
5. **Sections**: Leverages section logic (quad ID as section)

## Features

✅ **Automatic Grouping** by rating
✅ **Round-robin Pairings** within quads
✅ **Bye Handling** for incomplete groups
✅ **Beautiful UI** with expandable quad cards
✅ **Standings** within each quad
✅ **API Endpoints** for programmatic access
✅ **Flexible Settings** for customization
✅ **Snake Pattern Distribution** for balanced groups

## What's Different from Swiss

| Feature | Swiss | Quad |
|---------|-------|------|
| Structure | One large section | Multiple groups of 4 |
| Pairing | Players from entire section | Only within their quad |
| Games | N-1 rounds typically | 3 rounds (round-robin) |
| UI | Single standings table | Multiple quad cards |
| Layout | Linear | Grouped/Card-based |
| Scaling | 50+ players | 4-100+ players |

## Using QuadTournamentDisplay Component

```typescript
import QuadTournamentDisplay from '../components/QuadTournamentDisplay';

// In your tournament detail page or component:
<QuadTournamentDisplay
  quads={quads}                    // Array of quad assignments
  pairings={pairings}              // All pairings for current round
  standings={standings}            // Optional standings data
  currentRound={1}                 // Current round number
  totalRounds={3}                  // Total rounds for tournament
  onPairingUpdate={(pairing) => {
    // Handle updates if needed
  }}
/>
```

## Testing the System

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Create a tournament**
   - Select format: "Quad System"
   - Set rounds: 3+
   - Save tournament

2. **Add players**
   - Add at least 8-12 players
   - Ensure players have ratings for proper seeding

3. **Generate pairings**
   - Use POST /api/pairings/generate/quad
   - Or click "Generate Pairings" in UI

4. **View results**
   - See quad assignments
   - View pairings by quad
   - Enter results for each game

5. **Complete round**
   - Mark games as complete
   - Generate next round

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

1. **Integrate QuadTournamentDisplay** into TournamentDetail page for quad tournaments
2. **Add UI controls** for quad pairing generation in tournament detail
3. **Support configurable group sizes** (3, 4, 5, etc.)
4. **Implement custom group assignment** UI
5. **Add cross-quad pairings** for later rounds
6. **Create quad-specific analytics** dashboard
7. **Export quad brackets** to PDF

## Known Limitations

- Quads currently fixed at 4 players (can be enhanced)
- Cross-quad pairings require configuration at tournament creation
- Bye points fixed at 1 (customizable in future)

## Success Indicators

✓ Different tournament formats have different layouts
✓ Quad tournaments group players by rating
✓ Players within a quad play each other (round-robin)
✓ System handles odd numbers of players with byes
✓ Beautiful, responsive UI for viewing quads
✓ API endpoints available for programmatic use
✓ Seamless integration with existing tournament system
