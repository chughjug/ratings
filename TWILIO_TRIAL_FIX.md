# Twilio SMS Delivery Issue - Fix Guide

## Problem
Error code 30032: Message not delivered to 980-220-3489

## Root Cause
Twilio **Trial Accounts** require phone numbers to be verified before sending SMS. This is a security feature to prevent spam.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Verify the Phone Number (Recommended)

1. **Go to Twilio Verified Numbers:**
   https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/verified

2. **Click "Add a new number"**

3. **Enter the phone number:** +19802203489

4. **Choose verification method:**
   - Click "Call me" or "Text me"
   - Enter the verification code when prompted
   
5. **Once verified**, SMS notifications will work automatically!

### Option 2: Upgrade to Production Account

1. **Go to Billing:**
   https://console.twilio.com/billing/overview

2. **Add a payment method** (credit card)

3. **Account automatically upgrades** - no verification needed for US numbers

**Note:** You still get $15.50 credit, so first usage remains free!

## For Tournament Use

### During Tournament Setup

**Since you're sending to tournament players with various phone numbers**, you have two options:

### Option A: Verify Player Numbers (For Trial)
- Add player phone numbers to your Twilio verified list
- Up to 100 verified numbers on trial account
- Good for small tournaments

### Option B: Upgrade Account (For Production)
- No verification needed
- Can send to any valid US phone number
- Better for production use
- Still includes $15.50 credit
