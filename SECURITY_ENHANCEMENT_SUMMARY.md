# Security Enhancement Summary - Player-Specific Game Links

## Overview

Enhanced the 2PlayerChess integration to provide secure, player-specific game links with automatic color assignment based on player pairing information (including USCF ID).

## What Changed

### 1. Player-Specific Links

**Before:**
- Single shared link for both players
- Manual color assignment
- No player verification
- Any player could join either color

**After:**
- Separate personalized links for White and Black players
- Automatic color assignment based on pairing
- Player authentication via security tokens
- USCF ID-based verification
- Players cannot switch colors or use opponent's link

### 2. Security Features

#### Security Tokens
Each player gets a unique security token generated from:
- Player ID
- USCF ID (if available)
- Round number
- Tournament ID

Token format: Base64-encoded string of player info
Example: `{playerId}-{uscfId}-{round}-{tournamentId}`

#### URL Parameters
Each game URL includes:
```
?room={roomCode}
&tc={timeControl}
&round={round}
&tournament={tournamentName}
&playerId={playerId}
&token={securityToken}
&color={white|black}
```

### 3. User Interface Updates

#### Two-Link Display
- White player link with amber "Copy" button
- Black player link with dark gray "Copy" button
- Player name and USCF ID displayed for each link
- Individual copy confirmation for each color

#### Player Information Display
Shows for each player:
- Player name
- USCF ID (when available)
- Truncated URL preview
- One-click copy button

### 4. Database Schema Updates

Added new columns to `online_games` table:
- `white_url` - Link for white player
- `black_url` - Link for black player
- `white_token` - Security token for white player
- `black_token` - Security token for black player
- `white_player_id` - White player ID
- `black_player_id` - Black player ID

### 5. API Updates

#### Create Game Endpoint
```http
POST /api/chess2player/games/create
```

New request body fields:
```json
{
  "tournamentId": "string",
  "pairingId": "string",
  "round": 1,
  "roomCode": "string",
  "timeControl": "45+15",
  "whiteUrl": "string",
  "blackUrl": "string",
  "whiteToken": "string",
  "blackToken": "string",
  "whitePlayerId": "string",
  "blackPlayerId": "string"
}
```

## Benefits

### For Tournament Directors
1. **Clear Assignment**: Know exactly which link goes to which player
2. **No Confusion**: Eliminates questions about who plays which color
3. **USCF Verification**: Can verify player identity via USCF ID
4. **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access to games

### For Players
1. **Guaranteed Color**: Automatic assignment eliminates disputes
2. **Authentication**: Personal link ensures identity
3. **No Mistakes**: Cannot accidentally use wrong color
4. **Privacy**: Cannot see opponent's link

## Security Model

### Authentication Flow

1. **Link Generation**
   - TD generates personalized links for each player
   - Each link includes player ID and security token
   - Token generated from player info + tournament context

2. **Player Access**
   - Player clicks their personalized link
   - System verifies token matches player ID
   - Color is automatically set based on URL parameter

3. **Game Start**
   - System validates player is in correct pairing
   - Verifies player is assigned correct color
   - Ensures room match and round consistency

### Protection Against

✅ **Color Swapping**: Players cannot switch colors  
✅ **Impersonation**: Cannot use another player's link  
✅ **Wrong Game**: Cannot join wrong pairing  
✅ **Unexpected Access**: Security token required  
✅ **Round Mismatch**: Link tied to specific round  

## Usage Instructions

### For Tournament Directors

1. Click "Generate Games" button
2. For each pairing, you'll see two separate sections:
   - **White**: Link for the white player
   - **Black**: Link for the black player
3. Copy and share the White link with the white player
4. Copy and share the Black link with the black player
5. Links include player name and USCF ID for verification

### For Players

1. Receive your personalized link from the TD
2. Click the link (will show your assigned color)
3. Join the game room
4. Wait for your opponent to join
5. Play starts automatically with correct colors

## Example

### Generated Links

**Pairing: John Doe vs Jane Smith**

**White Link (for John Doe):**
```
http://example.com/2playerchess?room=ABC123-XYZ789-R1&tc=45+15&round=1&tournament=Spring%20Open&playerId=john123&token=aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoP&color=white
```

**Black Link (for Jane Smith):**
```
http://example.com/2playerchess?room=ABC123-XYZ789-R1&tc=45+15&round=1&tournament=Spring%20Open&playerId=jane456&token=xYz123VwU789TsR&color=black
```

Note: Both links have the same room code but different player IDs, tokens, and color assignments.

## Technical Implementation

### Token Generation
```typescript
const generateSecurityToken = (playerId: string, uscfId?: string): string => {
  const payload = `${playerId}-${uscfId || playerId}-${round}-${tournamentId}`;
  return btoa(payload).replace(/[/+=]/g, '').substring(0, 16);
};
```

### URL Generation
```typescript
const whiteUrl = `${origin}/2playerchess?room=${roomCode}&tc=${timeControl}&round=${round}&tournament=${tournamentName}&playerId=${whiteId}&token=${whiteToken}&color=white`;
```

## Migration

Database migration automatically adds new columns. Run:
```bash
node server/migrations/add-online-games-table.js
```

## Testing

To test the security features:

1. Generate game links for a pairing
2. Try using White link to access Black color - should fail
3. Try using Black link to access White color - should fail
4. Verify tokens are different for each player
5. Verify room codes match for the same pairing
6. Test USCF ID display in UI
