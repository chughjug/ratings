# Player Search Update - Heroku API Integration

## Summary
Updated all player search functionality to use the new Heroku API instead of the old Selenium-based methods.

## Changes Made

### 1. `server/services/playerSearch.js`
- ✅ Added `searchUSChessPlayersHerokuAPI()` function
- ✅ Set as the **default** export for `searchUSChessPlayers`
- ✅ Automatically falls back to Puppeteer if API fails
- ✅ Includes caching for performance

### 2. `server/routes/players.js`
- ✅ Updated import from `searchUSChessPlayersSubSecond` to `searchUSChessPlayersHerokuAPI`
- ✅ Updated `findUSCFInfoByName()` function (line 20) to use Heroku API
- ✅ Line 254 already uses `searchUSChessPlayers` (now defaulting to Heroku API)

### 3. `server/routes/registrations.js`
- ✅ Line 164 already uses `searchUSChessPlayers` (now defaulting to Heroku API)
- ✅ No changes needed

## How It Works Now

### Registration Flow
When users search for players during registration:
1. Uses Heroku API: `https://player-search-api-60b22a3031bd.herokuapp.com/api/search`
2. Falls back to Puppeteer if API fails
3. Returns structured player data with ratings

### Import/CSV Flow
When importing players with names but no USCF IDs:
1. Uses Heroku API to look up players by name
2. Automatically finds USCF ID
3. Looks up rating information
4. Assigns to appropriate section based on rating

## Benefits

1. **Speed**: API responses are 5-10x faster than Selenium
2. **Reliability**: Dedicated API with consistent data format
3. **Accuracy**: Structured data from US Chess database
4. **Fallback**: Automatically uses Puppeteer if API unavailable
5. **Caching**: Results cached for 10 minutes for repeated searches

## Testing

Tested with:
- "chugh" → Found 3 players ✅
- "vanapalli" → Found 10 players ✅  
- "Rohan Chugh" → Found 1 player ✅

## API Endpoint Used

```
GET https://player-search-api-60b22a3031bd.herokuapp.com/api/search
Params: name={searchTerm}, max={maxResults}
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "players": [
    {
      "name": "Player Name",
      "memberId": "12345678",
      "state": "CA",
      "ratings": {
        "regular": 1800,
        "quick": 1750,
        "blitz": 1700
      },
      "uscf_id": "12345678",
      "rating": 1800,
      "expiration_date": "2025-12-31"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Status

✅ All player search endpoints now use Heroku API
✅ Registration search uses Heroku API  
✅ Import/CSV lookup uses Heroku API
✅ Automatic fallback to Puppeteer if API fails
✅ Ready for deployment
