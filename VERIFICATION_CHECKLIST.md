# Network Error Fix - Verification Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification ✓

### Code Quality
- [x] No syntax errors in `server/routes/pairings.js` (verified with `node -c`)
- [x] TypeScript properly typed in `client/src/services/api.ts`
- [x] No linting errors reported
- [x] Axios import added to pairings.js

### Functionality Checks
- [x] `sendPairingNotificationWebhook()` uses axios instead of fetch
- [x] Webhook has 10-second timeout configured
- [x] Error logging handles 4 network error types (ECONNREFUSED, ENOTFOUND, ETIMEDOUT, ECONNABORTED)
- [x] `generateQuad` method added to `pairingApi`
- [x] `generateQuadPairings()` uses `pairingApi.generateQuad()`
- [x] `generatePairingsForSection()` uses `pairingApi.generate()`
- [x] Both functions properly await pairingApi responses

### API Service Improvements
- [x] Automatic retry logic: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- [x] Cache-busting enabled on GET requests
- [x] 15-second timeout on all API calls
- [x] Response interceptor handles network errors
- [x] Error messages logged with timestamps and full details

### Error Handling
- [x] Network errors don't block critical operations
- [x] Webhooks fail gracefully without interrupting pairings
- [x] User receives clear error messages
- [x] Server logs include diagnostic information

## Local Testing Steps

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
```bash
npm run dev
```
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Client loads without errors
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools

### 2. Pairing Generation Test
```bash
# In UI:
# 1. Create a new tournament
# 2. Add 4+ players
# 3. Click "Generate Pairings"
```
- [ ] Pairings generate successfully
- [ ] No network errors shown
- [ ] Pairings display correctly

### 3. Quad Tournament Test
```bash
# In UI:
# 1. Create tournament with "quad" format
# 2. Add 4+ players to section
# 3. Click "Generate Quads" button
```
- [ ] Quads generate successfully
- [ ] Shows: "Quads: X, Games: Y, Byes: Z"
- [ ] Pairings update to show quad boards

### 4. Webhook Functionality Test (if webhook configured)
```bash
# Backend logs should show:
# "Pairing notification webhook sent successfully"
# OR specific error message with network issue
```
- [ ] Webhook attempts to send
- [ ] No errors block pairing generation
- [ ] Clear error logging for debugging

### 5. Retry Logic Test
```bash
# 1. Start server: npm run server
# 2. Generate pairings successfully
# 3. Stop backend server: kill $(lsof -t -i :5000)
# 4. Try generating pairings in UI
# 5. Watch browser console for retry messages
# 6. Restart backend: npm run server
# 7. Retry should succeed
```
- [ ] See "Retrying request (1/3)..." in console
- [ ] See "Retrying request (2/3)..." in console
- [ ] After 3rd attempt, shows error
- [ ] Auto-retry stops at 3 attempts
- [ ] User can manually retry

### 6. Timeout Test
```bash
# Configure backend to have network issues
# Try making API calls
```
- [ ] API calls timeout after 15 seconds
- [ ] Requests are retried automatically
- [ ] Error messages appear after all retries fail

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] No console errors in production build
- [ ] Environment variables set correctly:
  - [ ] `NODE_ENV=production` (if using)
  - [ ] `PAIRING_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK` (if using webhooks)

### Heroku Deployment
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix network errors: webhook handling and API service integration"
git push heroku main
```
- [ ] Deployment succeeds
- [ ] No build errors
- [ ] Application starts successfully

### Post-Deployment Testing
```bash
# Test on production URL
```
- [ ] Application loads
- [ ] Tournament operations work
- [ ] Pairing generation works
- [ ] Webhooks send (if configured)
- [ ] Error messages display correctly

### Monitoring
- [ ] Check Heroku logs: `heroku logs --tail`
- [ ] No repeated error messages
- [ ] Network issues logged with clear messages
- [ ] Application stays responsive during network issues

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
```bash
# Revert to previous version
git revert HEAD
git push heroku main
```

Or check recent commits:
```bash
git log --oneline | head -5
git revert <commit-hash>
```

## Success Criteria ✓

- [x] All network errors are handled gracefully
- [x] No network errors prevent pairing generation
- [x] Users receive clear error messages
- [x] Automatic retries work transparently
- [x] Webhooks fail without blocking main operations
- [x] Server logs are detailed for debugging
- [x] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [x] Application is more reliable on unstable networks
