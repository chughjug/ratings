/**
 * Team Swiss Pairing System
 * Implements board-by-board team tournaments using Swiss system pairing
 * 
 * How it works:
 * - Teams are paired using Swiss system based on team match scores
 * - Each team vs team match consists of multiple board games
 * - Players are assigned to boards by rating (board 1 = strongest)
 * - Board 1 vs Board 1, Board 2 vs Board 2, etc.
 * - Team wins the match by winning more individual boards
