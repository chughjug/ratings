## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Organization Branding System

**Database Changes:**
- Added `branding_logo` column to organizations table
- Added `branding_primary_color` column (default: #3b82f6)
- Added `branding_secondary_color` column (default: #8b5cf6)
- Added `branding_accent_color` column (default: #10b981)
- Added `branding_settings` column for JSON settings

**Files Modified:**
- `server/database.js` - Added branding columns to organizations table

**What It Does:**
- Organizations can now upload custom logos
- Custom color themes for branding (primary, secondary, accent)
- Branding settings stored as JSON for additional customization
- Ready for integration with branded exports and PDFs
- Support for embeddable widgets with organization branding

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Team Sonneborn-Berger Calculation

**What It Does:**
- Calculates team Sonneborn-Berger scores for team tournaments
- Sum of defeated opponents' scores + half of drawn opponents' scores
- Properly handles team match results
- Integrates with existing team standings

**Files Modified:**
- `server/services/teamService.js` - Added `calculateTeamSonnebornBerger()` function

**Implementation:**
```javascript
function calculateTeamSonnebornBerger(db, tournamentId, teamStandings) {
  // Calculate Sonneborn-Berger for each team
  // Sum of opponent scores for wins + half for draws
}
```

**Integration:**
- Automatically calculates when team standings are generated
- Includes error handling and fallback
- Sorts teams using Sonneborn-Berger as tiebreaker

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Persistent Room Storage (Redis Support)

**What It Does:**
- Supports Redis for persistent chess room storage
- Graceful fallback to in-memory storage if Redis unavailable
- Room data persists across server restarts
- Production-ready with automatic reconnection

**Files Modified:**
- `server/services/chessRooms.js` - Complete rewrite with Redis support

**Features:**
- Automatic Redis connection if `REDIS_URL` environment variable is set
- Fallback to in-memory storage if Redis unavailable
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Async/await for all room operations
- Room data stored with `chess_room:` prefix in Redis

**Usage:**
```javascript
// Set REDIS_URL environment variable to enable
// Example: REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

// Or use in-memory storage (no configuration needed)
```

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Opponent Checking (Database Queries)

**What It Does:**
- Checks if players have already met in tournament history
- Prevents duplicate pairings
- Database-backed pairing validation
- Supports tournament-specific opponent tracking

**Files Modified:**
- `server/utils/bbpPairingsDirect.js` - Updated `canBePaired()` method

**Implementation:**
```javascript
async canBePaired(player1, player2, tournament, db = null) {
  // Check database for previous pairings
  // Returns false if players already met
  // Returns true if pairing is valid
}
```

**Features:**
- Checks both player as white and black
- Database queries for tournament history
- Graceful error handling
- Fallback to simplified checking if database unavailable

---

## üìä Technical Details

### Team Sonneborn-Berger Algorithm

The implementation calculates Sonneborn-Berger for teams by:
1. Getting all team match results for the tournament
2. For each team, summing opponent total scores:
   - **Win**: Add full opponent score
   - **Draw**: Add half opponent score (0.5 √ó opponent score)
   - **Loss**: Add nothing (0)
3. Returning a map of team IDs to Sonneborn-Berger scores

### Redis Implementation

The chess rooms service now:
- Attempts to connect to Redis if available
- Falls back to in-memory storage automatically
- Uses async/await for all operations
- Provides error handling and logging
- Stores rooms with namespace prefix (`chess_room:`)

### Opponent Checking

The pairing system now:
- Queries database for existing pairings
- Checks both white/black player combinations
- Returns boolean indicating if pairing is valid
- Provides fallback if database unavailable

---

## üöÄ How to Use

### Organization Branding

1. **Update an organization** with branding settings:
```javascript
{
  branding_logo: "https://example.com/logo.png",
  branding_primary_color: "#FF5733",
  branding_secondary_color: "#33FF57",
  branding_accent_color: "#3357FF",
  branding_settings: {
    // Additional settings
  }
}
```

### Team Sonneborn-Berger

Team standings automatically include Sonneborn-Berger scores:
```javascript
{
  team_id: "team123",
  team_name: "Chess Masters",
  team_sonneborn_berger: 25.5  // Calculated automatically
}
```

### Redis Room Storage

Set environment variable:
```bash
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

Or use in-memory (no setup required).

### Opponent Checking

Pass database to pairing functions:
```javascript
const canPair = await canBePaired(player1, player2, tournament, db);
```
