# âœ… Google Forms Configuration Ready

## Configuration Applied

Your FORMS_CONFIG has been successfully updated with the following settings:

```javascript
const FORMS_CONFIG = {
  ENABLE_FORM_IMPORT: true,
  FORM_ID: '15fTL-FenfGKK3s_6IMcu6FeeYFONIyJUD9s0eWSqCS4',
  API_BASE_URL: 'https://chess-tournament-director-6ce5e76147d7.herokuapp.com/',
  API_KEY: 'demo-key-123',
  TOURNAMENT_ID: 'tournament-2',
  CHECK_INTERVAL: 5,
  RESPONSE_LIMIT: 100,
  SEND_CONFIRMATION_EMAILS: true,
  AUTO_ASSIGN_SECTIONS: true,
  LOOKUP_RATINGS: true
};
```

## What This Does

âœ… **Google Form Integration**
- Form ID: Points to your tournament registration form
- Auto-detects form submissions every 5 minutes
- Processes responses in real-time

âœ… **API Connection**
- Connects to: https://chess-tournament-director-6ce5e76147d7.herokuapp.com/
- Tournament: tournament-2
- API Key: demo-key-123 (replace if needed)

âœ… **Player Processing**
- âœ“ Automatically looks up USCF ratings
- âœ“ Auto-assigns sections based on rating
- âœ“ Sends confirmation emails

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Update Google Apps Script
1. Go to your Google Sheet
2. Extensions â†’ Apps Script
3. Replace the FORMS_CONFIG section with the settings above (already done!)
4. Save

### Step 2: Run Setup
1. In Apps Script editor, find: `setupFormImport()`
2. Click the Play button (â–¶)
3. Grant permissions when prompted
4. You'll see: "âœ… Form import configured!"

### Step 3: Test It
1. Submit a test response to your form
2. Wait 1 minute
3. Check the "FormImportLog" sheet in your Google Sheet
4. Verify the player was added to your tournament

## What Happens When Someone Submits

```
Form Submission
    â†“
Google Apps Script detects it
    â†“
Extracts player data from form fields
    â†“
Sends to API with:
  - lookup_ratings: true (looks up USCF data)
  - auto_assign_sections: true (assigns sections)
    â†“
Player added to tournament-2
    â†“
Confirmation email sent
    â†“
Import logged in FormImportLog sheet
```

## Form Field Mapping

The script automatically detects these form questions:

| Form Question | Maps To |
|---|---|
| "Player Name" | player.name âœ“ |
| "USCF ID" | player.uscf_id |
| "Email" | player.email |
| "Phone" | player.phone |
| "School" | player.school |
| "Grade" | player.grade |
| "Parent Name" | player.parent_name |
| "Parent Email" | player.parent_email |
| "Parent Phone" | player.parent_phone |
| "Emergency Contact" | player.emergency_contact |
| "Notes" | player.notes |

Make sure your form has at least a "Player Name" field!

## Configuration Details

### LOOKUP_RATINGS: true
- Automatically searches USCF database for player rating
- Uses player name to find match
- Updates rating if found
- Affects section assignment

### AUTO_ASSIGN_SECTIONS: true
- Uses player rating to assign section
- Sections defined in tournament settings
- Examples: U1600, U1400, Open
- Can be overridden manually

### SEND_CONFIRMATION_EMAILS: true
- Sends email when player is imported
- Email goes to player.email from form
- Subject: "Registration Confirmation - tournament-2"
- Requires Gmail access in Google Apps Script

### CHECK_INTERVAL: 5
- Checks for new form responses every 5 minutes
- Faster = more frequent API calls
- Slower = might miss responses during peak times
- 5 minutes is a good balance

## Monitoring

### Check Import Status
1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Look for "FormImportLog" sheet
3. Each row shows:
   - Timestamp of import
   - Number of players imported
   - Success/failure
   - Error messages if any
   - Details of what was imported

### Troubleshooting
- **No imports happening?** Check if ENABLE_FORM_IMPORT is true
- **Wrong data?** Check FormImportLog for error messages
- **Missing ratings?** Make sure LOOKUP_RATINGS is true
- **Need real-time?** 5-minute check is current limit (time-based triggers only)

## Advanced: Real-Time Processing (Optional)

To get real-time processing instead of 5-minute intervals:

1. Open your Google Form
2. Click â‹® (three dots) â†’ Script editor
3. In the Form Apps Script editor, add:
   ```javascript
   function onFormSubmit(e) {
     // This will be called immediately on submission
     // Form Apps Script will call your sheet's onFormSubmit function
   }
   ```
4. This enables instant processing but requires form-level scripts

**Note:** For now, the 5-minute check is simpler and catches all responses reliably.

## Next Steps

âœ… Configuration complete - ready to deploy!

1. **Run setupFormImport()** in Apps Script
2. **Test with a form submission**
3. **Check FormImportLog sheet** for results
4. **Verify player added** to tournament-2
