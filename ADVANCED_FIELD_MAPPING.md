# ‚úÖ Advanced Field Mapping System

## What Changed

Upgraded from simple keyword matching to **intelligent field matching with scoring**!

### Old System ‚ùå
- Basic `includes()` checking
- Fixed keyword list per field
- Could confuse similar fields (e.g., "name" matching parent name)
- No debugging for failed matches

### New System ‚úÖ
- **Score-based matching** (highest score wins)
- **Exclude keywords** to prevent false matches
- **Field validation** (email, phone, numbers)
- **Debug logging** for unmatched fields
- **Fully customizable** via FIELD_MAPPING config

## How It Works

### 1. Field Mapping Configuration

```javascript
const FIELD_MAPPING = {
  name: {
    keywords: ['name', 'player', 'full name', ...],
    excludeKeywords: ['parent', 'guardian', 'emergency'],
    required: true
  },
  email: {
    keywords: ['email', 'email address', 'e-mail'],
    excludeKeywords: ['parent', 'guardian']  // Prevents matching parent emails
  },
  parent_email: {
    keywords: ['parent email', 'parent e-mail', 'guardian email'],
    excludeKeywords: []
  }
  // ... more fields
};
```

### 2. Scoring Algorithm

Each form question is scored against each field:

```
"What is your parent's email?"
                    ‚Üì
    Score: 30 points (contains "email")
                    ‚Üì
    Check exclude keywords: "parent" found!
                    ‚Üì
    EXCLUDED ‚ùå (score = 0)

"Parent Email Address:"
                    ‚Üì
    Score: 100 points (exact match with "parent email")
                    ‚Üì
    No exclude keywords
                    ‚Üì
    MATCHED ‚úÖ as parent_email
```

### 3. Scoring Rules

| Match Type | Score | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Exact match | 100 | "email" = "email" |
| Starts with | 50 | "Email Address" starts with "email" |
| Ends with | 50 | "Your Email" ends with "email" |
| Contains | 30 | "What is your email?" contains "email" |
| Excluded | 0 | "parent" keyword found |
| Threshold | 20+ | Must score ‚â•20 to match |

## Adding Custom Fields

### Example: Add "Gender" Field

1. **Edit FIELD_MAPPING**:
```javascript
const FIELD_MAPPING = {
  // ... existing fields ...
  gender: {
    keywords: ['gender', 'sex', 'male/female', 'gender identity'],
    excludeKeywords: []
  }
};
```

2. **Add to field processing** (in switch statement):
```javascript
case 'gender':
  player.gender = answerValue.toLowerCase();
  break;
```

3. **Done!** It will now auto-detect gender fields

### Example: Add "Age" Field

```javascript
age: {
  keywords: ['age', 'birth date', 'date of birth', 'how old'],
  excludeKeywords: []
}
```

## Exclude Keywords (Preventing False Matches)

Exclude keywords prevent false matches:

```javascript
// ‚ùå Bad: Matches any field with "name"
name: {
  keywords: ['name'],
  excludeKeywords: []  // No protection!
}
// Result: matches "What's your parent's name?" ‚úó

// ‚úÖ Good: Protects from parent/emergency names
name: {
  keywords: ['name', 'player', 'full name'],
  excludeKeywords: ['parent', 'guardian', 'emergency']
}
// Result: correctly identifies player name only ‚úì
```

## Debugging Field Extraction

When a form is imported, console logs show:

```
Field extraction: 8 matched, 0 unmatched
```

Or if there are problems:

```
Field extraction: 6 matched, 2 unmatched
‚ö†Ô∏è Unmatched field: "How many tournaments?" = "5"
‚ö†Ô∏è Unmatched field: "Preferred color?" = "Blue"
```

### What to Do with Unmatched Fields

1. **Check the field name** - Is it spelled correctly?
2. **Add keywords** to FIELD_MAPPING if needed
3. **Adjust exclude keywords** if it's being excluded

### Example: Fix "Chess Rating" Not Matching

**Problem**: "What's your current chess rating?" not matching `rating` field

**Solution**: Add keyword to FIELD_MAPPING:
```javascript
rating: {
  keywords: ['rating', 'elo', 'chess rating', 'current rating', 'chess elo'],
  excludeKeywords: []
}
```

## Field Processing

Special handling for different data types:

### Numbers (Rating)
- Converts to float
- Validates it's positive
- Rejects invalid numbers

### Names
- Converts to Title Case
- Trims whitespace
- Example: "john doe" ‚Üí "John Doe"

### Email
- Converts to lowercase
- Validates has "@" symbol
- Normalizes format

### Phone
- Removes all non-digits
- Keeps only numbers 0-9
- Example: "(555) 123-4567" ‚Üí "5551234567"

## Complete Field List

All supported fields with examples:

| Field | Keywords | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| name | name, player, full name | "What is your name?" |
| uscf_id | uscf, member id, chess id | "USCF ID Number" |
| fide_id | fide | "FIDE Rating ID" |
| rating | rating, elo, chess rating | "Your Rating" |
| section | section, division, category | "What section?" |
| email | email | "Your Email" |
| phone | phone, telephone | "Phone Number" |

## Testing Your Mappings

### Method 1: Console Logs
1. Submit test form
2. Check Execution Log (View ‚Üí Execution log)
3. Look for "Field extraction" messages

### Method 2: Check Extract Accuracy
1. Submit form with test data
2. Go to Tournament UI
3. Verify player data matches form input

## Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use descriptive form question titles
- Be consistent with naming (e.g., always "Email" or "Email Address")
- Use exclude keywords to prevent conflicts
- Test with real form data

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Use ambiguous titles like "Personal Info"
- Mix field meanings (rating + section)
- Skip exclude keywords for similar fields
- Assume exact matches without testing

## Example: Robust Form Questions

**Good form structure**:
1. "Player Name" (matches: name)
2. "USCF ID Number" (matches: uscf_id)
3. "Chess Rating" (matches: rating)
4. "Section/Division" (matches: section)
5. "Email Address" (matches: email)
6. "Phone Number" (matches: phone)
7. "School Name" (matches: school)
8. "Grade Level" (matches: grade)
9. "Parent/Guardian Name" (matches: parent_name)
10. "Parent Email" (matches: parent_email)
11. "Emergency Contact Name" (matches: emergency_contact)
12. "Additional Notes" (matches: notes)

**Result**: 100% field detection! ‚úÖ

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Field not detected | Add keyword to FIELD_MAPPING |
| Wrong field detected | Add exclude keyword |
| Multiple fields fail | Check form question titles |
| Numbers invalid | Ensure they're in correct format |
| Emails not matching | Check for "@" symbol |
