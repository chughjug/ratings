# Error Fix Summary - October 24, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **API Connection Error (Port Mismatch)**
**Problem:** The frontend was trying to connect to `http://localhost:3000/api` but the backend server runs on port `5000`.

**Solution:** Updated `/client/src/services/api.ts` to point to the correct backend URL:
```javascript
// Changed from:
return 'http://localhost:3000/api';

// To:
return 'http://localhost:5000/api';
```

### 2. **Content Security Policy (CSP) Errors**
**Problem:** The Helmet CSP middleware was blocking API requests with:
- "Refused to connect to '<URL>' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive"
- The `connectSrc` directive was not set, causing network calls to be blocked

**Solution:** Updated `/server/index.js` Helmet configuration to:
- Add `connectSrc` directive allowing `http://localhost:5000`, `http://127.0.0.1:5000`, and websockets
- Add `frameSrc` and `fontSrc` directives for complete CSP coverage
- Disable `crossOriginEmbedderPolicy` for development compatibility

**Updated CSP Configuration:**
```javascript
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'", "http://localhost:5000", "http://127.0.0.1:5000", "ws://localhost:*", "http:", "https:"],
      frameSrc: ["'self'", "https:"],
      fontSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    },
  },
  crossOriginEmbedderPolicy: false,
}));
```

## Result

âœ… **Both issues are now resolved:**
- Backend server is running on port 5000
- Frontend is correctly configured to communicate with port 5000
- CSP policies allow API calls to proceed without errors
- CORS is properly configured for development

## How to Access

- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API:** http://localhost:5000/api

## Next Steps

If you encounter any further issues:
1. Check that both servers are running (port 3000 for frontend, port 5000 for backend)
2. Verify browser console for any remaining errors
3. Clear browser cache if needed (Ctrl+Shift+Delete or Cmd+Shift+Delete)
